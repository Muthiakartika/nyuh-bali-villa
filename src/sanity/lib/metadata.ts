/**
 * One SEO block laid over a route's existing metadata, field by field.
 *
 * Field-level rather than document-level, for the same reason
 * `getPropertySite` falls back per field: an editor who fills in a social
 * description and nothing else should not lose the title the route already
 * publishes. Every route can adopt this without changing a byte of what it
 * emits today.
 *
 * The Open Graph pair falls back to the search pair, which is what the live
 * site publishes — Yoast sends the same string to both. `og:image` stays
 * absent unless someone sets one, because the live site publishes none and
 * picking a photograph to stand for the whole business is a brand decision,
 * not a default to invent.
