 * and the frame, never in a page band, and the whole-site audit checks it —
 * `main > section` with a background of `rgb(38, 30, 19)` must be 0. An editor
 * given the option would break that with one click and nothing would say so.
 * The dark shapes that do exist (the "Best Price Guaranteed" plate, the awards
 * base, the footer) are drawn by their own components, not by this field.
 *
 * The labels name the colour rather than the token. "Sand" and "Deep sand" are
 * what `globals.css` calls them and what the code passes through, but they are
 * not what someone choosing a background is looking at.

 * every band heading in the same `text-section` scale whichever tag it uses,
 * so choosing H3 changes the document outline a screen reader and a search
 * engine read, and changes nothing a sighted visitor sees. That is the point
 * — a subsection that looks like a band but sits *under* the band above it
 * should say so.
 *
 * **H1 is not offered.** A page's `<h1>` is its hero or its opening section,
 * every page has exactly one, and the whole-site audit checks that. Letting a
 * band claim one is the single easiest way for an editor to break page
 * structure without seeing anything change, so the ladder starts at H2.
 * `page.sections` validates the other half of the same rule — that a page
 * carries exactly one section capable of producing an `<h1>`.
