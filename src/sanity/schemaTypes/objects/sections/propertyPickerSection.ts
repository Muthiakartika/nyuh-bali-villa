/**
 * The homepage, and the only section it has.

 * Home was the one hand-written route never handed to the Studio — the other
 * 23 all have a `page` document, and an editor looking for "the page where you
 * pick which resort" found nothing in the Pages list. It was left out because
 * it is the one route with no property: its chrome is `HomeHeader`/
 * `HomeFooter`, not a resort's, so none of the per-property sections apply.
 *
 * Both panels live in **one** section rather than one section each, for two
 * reasons: the page is a single choice rather than a stack of bands, and
 * exactly one `<h1>` per page is an invariant here — the first panel renders
 * it and the rest render `<h2>`, which cannot be got wrong if the order is the
 * array's own. Adding a third property is then just a third entry.
