 * One half of the homepage's Seminyak/Ubud picker.
 *
 * **The landing page is now the choice itself.** It used to be two square
 * cards floating in a padded container between a dark header and a dark
 * footer, each photo sitting under a flat `ink/50` wash — half the image's
 * light thrown away — with a full paragraph of copy stacked over the middle
 * of it. Both properties ended up looking like the same grey-brown rectangle.
 *
 * Each panel is now a full-height plane of photography meeting its neighbour
 * at a seam, with a gradient weighted to the bottom so only the area behind
 * the text is darkened and the rest of the picture is left alone. The name is
 * set at display scale, the description sits under it at a proper reading
 * measure, and the gold rule between them extends on hover.
 *
 * `headingLevel` exists because there should only be one `<h1>` per page, and
 * this component renders twice — so the caller decides which tag applies
 * rather than the component guessing.
